# SEO Rules

1. Never use `meta keywords` on any page.
2. Every route must set a self-referencing canonical URL.
3. Every indexable page must have exactly one clear, intent-focused `<h1>`.
4. Every page must render breadcrumbs from route data (no hardcoded per-page breadcrumb blocks).
5. Every page must include `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD schema.
6. Home page must include `Organization` JSON-LD schema.
7. Blog/article pages must include both `Article` and `FAQPage` schema when FAQ content exists.
8. Add `hreflang` alternates only when equivalent translated pages exist; include self language plus all alternates.
9. Keep title and meta description unique per route and aligned with primary search intent.
10. Use descriptive image `alt` text for all editorial images and keep image assets crawlable.
