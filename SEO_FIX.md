# SEO Fix Backlog

## High Priority
- Add dedicated hero/featured image for `the-disposable-email-epidemic` article and expose it in `Article` schema as a page-specific image URL.
- Add dedicated hero/featured image for `value-proposition` article and expose it in `Article` schema as a page-specific image URL.
- Add at least one contextual inline image per blog article to improve visual scanability and image search eligibility.

## Blog Image Gaps (Current)
- `/the-disposable-email-epidemic`: no blog-specific featured image file in `public/` and no inline `<img>` content in article body.
- `/value-proposition`: no blog-specific featured image file in `public/` and no inline `<img>` content in article body.

## Medium Priority
- If non-English routes are added later, define language counterparts per slug and populate `hreflang` alternate links for each localized URL.
- Add `datePublished` and `dateModified` values to article schemas when publishing workflow metadata is available.
- Add author profile page and connect article schema `author.url` to strengthen E-E-A-T signals.
